# AutoReact
Automatic scrolling and reaction for FaceBook and Instagram.

## What actually is this?
This android app is a custom browser , integrated with a bot that can automatically scroll and/or react on posts in social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, reducing your hassle to do these manually.
Also, this blocks some fb ads/sponsored posts.

## How does it know the suitable reaction for every post?
Well... it doesn't. It scans the already existing reactions that others provided and just simply goes with the majority. (If a post has no reactions yet, this bot would skip the post too)

## Known bugs
Sometimes , if you set the auto scrolling speed to something high and also use auto reaction, Auto reaction might stop working after some time. This happens when the Auto reaction bot cannot keep up with the speed of posts being rendered and scrolled.
#### Could I not make the reaction bot faster?
No. Reacting too fast might make you sus in the eyes of facebook, thus your account might get temporarily restricted from reacting.

## Why did I make this?
Its tedious for me to use my damn fingers and react at every post I encounter. If its the same for you, try the apk in release section.
